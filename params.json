The site provides a reference manual covering many aspects of web programming.\r\n\r\n# Ubuntu Instructions\r\n\r\n You need to setup an Apache server as w3schools use #asp engine, which cannot be rendered directly by the browser.\r\n\r\n Creating server for ASP.NET applications in Ubuntu using Modmono\r\n  ModMono is an Apache module which provides ASP.NET support for Apache web server. We will be using Apache as an        alternative for Microsoft’s IIS in Windows.\r\n  \r\n  # Installation\r\n  Here is a nice tutorial to setting up the server, just follow its #installation part          https://ubuntuexperiment.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/running-aspnet-applications-in-ubuntu-using-modmono/\r\n\r\n  # Adding the offline website\r\n  We are going to create a site called W3schools. But first we need to create a configuration file for this site inside    the directory “etc/apache2/sites-available/”. To do this, execute the following command:\r\n  \r\n  sudo nautilus /etc/apache2/sites-available/ \r\n  \r\n  This will open the directory in Nautilus. Now right-click inside the window and create a new empty file and name it “W3schools.conf”. Then open the file using a text editor and paste the following text inside it, save and close.\r\n  \r\n    Alias /W3schools \"/var/www/W3schools\"\r\n    AddMonoApplications default \"/W3schools:/var/www/W3schools\"\r\n    <Location /W3schools>\r\n    SetHandler mono\r\n    </Location>\r\n    \r\n  You need to change the server root directory for W3schools to successfully work.\r\n    Run the command \r\n    \r\n    sudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf\r\n    \r\n  and change the following line to what you want:\r\n\r\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/html to /var/www/W3schools\r\n  \r\n  Also edit apache2.conf to do so run \r\n    sudo gedit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\r\n    \r\n    and find this\r\n      <Directory /var/www/html/>\r\n      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\r\n      AllowOverride None\r\n      Require all granted\r\n      </Directory>\r\n      \r\n and change /var/www/html to your preferred directory( /var/www/W3schools )\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now inside Nautilus, browse to /var/www/ directory and create a new folder called “W3schools”\r\n  \r\n2.Download and extract the zip file from the link below:\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxNDMvWYfeVEOUpOU1cwSndfVFU/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\nThen come the final steps where we enable the site and restart Apache one last time:\r\n\r\n    a2ensite Ubuntu\r\n    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\r\n    \r\nThat’s it! Now open your web browser and point to:\r\nhttp://localhost/W3schools/index.html\r\n\r\n#Windows instructions\r\n\r\n#part 1\r\n1. On the Start menu, click Settings and select Control Panel\r\n\r\n2. Double-click Add or Remove Programs\r\n\r\n3. Click Add/Remove Windows Components\r\n\r\n4. Install Internet Information Services (IIS)\r\n\r\n5. Look for a new folder called Inetpub on your hard drive( windows installation drive )\r\n\r\n6. Open the Inetpub folder, and find a folder named wwwroot\r\n\r\n#part 2\r\n\r\n  7. Download and extract the following file\r\n      https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxNDMvWYfeVEOUpOU1cwSndfVFU/view\r\n  8. Copy the contents from the folder www.3schools.com to wwwroot folder ( just copy the contents of the folder not the folder)\r\n  9. On the Start menu, find and open Internet Information Services (IIS)\r\n  10. Find Default Web Site under sites on the left side\r\n  11. Select the MIME type\r\n  12. Add new from the right side\r\n  13. Set File name extenstion to .asp and MIME type to text/html\r\n  14. Save and exit\r\n  15. That’s it! Now open your web browser and point to: http://localhost/index.html\r\n\r\n#Enjoy!!!    \r\n\r\n#Credits - W3schools.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
